# 5.1.1
- updated README regarding `VoidModel` usage in `Upload`

# 5.1.0

# 5.0.0

### **Breaking Changes**

- refresh token request is now sent via body.
  Reference: [Refreshing an Access Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
- **removal**: `refreshTokenHeaderKey` is removed since refreshToken should not be in the
  header.
  Reference: [Refreshing an Access Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)

### **New Features**

- Added `removeAccessTokenBeforeRefresh` : A new top-level option in NetKitManager to remove the
  access token from headers during a token refresh.
- Added `accessTokenPrefix`: Allows you to define a custom token prefix (e.g., Bearer, Token) when
  setting the access token.
- Introduced `onBeforeRefreshRequest` callback: Lets you modify the refresh token request before it
  is sent â€” useful for injecting custom headers or modifying the request body.
  Introduced `NetKitRequestOptions`: A new abstraction to simplify and standardize refresh token
  request configuration.
- Introduced `onRefreshFailed` callback: This callback is triggered when the refresh token request
  fails.
  It provides a way to handle errors or perform specific actions when the refresh token process
  encounters issues.
- Added `metadataDataKey`: Enables support for parsing the actual data nested inside metadata
  wrappers from API responses.
- Added `requestModelMeta` and `requestListMeta` methods:

### **Improvements**

Improved error handling in **ApiException**

- Added `debugMessage` and `error` fields to provide more detailed diagnostics.
- Better support for **SocketException** and network-related errors via `ApiException.fromJson`

# 4.0.0

- `Breaking change`: removed authenticate method
- `Breaking change`: refresh tokens are now parsed from only body, since it is a common practice
  to return the new access token and, if needed, the new refresh token via body for more security.
  If you want to handle the refresh token manually, you can use add custom interceptor to handle
  the refresh token.
  **Reference
  **: [Issuing an Access Token: Successful Response](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.1)
- `Breaking change`: updated `accessTokenKey` as `accessTokenHeaderKey`
- `Breaking change`: updated `refreshTokenKey` as `refreshTokenHeaderKey`
- added `accessTokenBodyKey` to `NetKitManager` to parse the access token from the body
- added `refreshTokenBodyKey` to `NetKitManager` to parse the refresh token from the body

# 3.6.0

- deprecated `authenticate` method

# 3.4.1

- added logger.error in _sendRequest method

# 3.4.0

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

- `logLevel` is removed, since INetKitLogger instance injected to the NetKitManager. This is
  done to provide more flexibility to the developers to use their own logger.
- `loggerEnabled` is renamed to `logInterceptorEnabled` in `NetKitManager` to provide more clarity.
- added `logger` parameter to the `NetKitManager` to provide more flexibility to the developers to
  use their own logger.

> Note: This release has breaking change.

- `Breaking change`: Renamed methods
    - `addBearerToken` to `setAccessToken`
    - `addRefreshToken` to `setRefreshToken`
    - `removeBearerToken` to `removeAccessToken`
- `Feature`: Added `refreshToken` feature. Refresh token is automatically refreshed when the access
  token is expired. Just add `refreshTokenPath` to the `NetKitManager` and it will automatically
  refresh the token. Note: the refresh token API in backend should return the new access token and,
  if needed, the new refresh token via headers for more security. If you want to handle the refresh
  token manually, you can use add custom interceptor to handle the refresh token.
